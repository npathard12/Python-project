Sports analysis for Indian Premier League

# Overview
This dataset is about the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament until the year 2017. It contains detailed information on each IPL match played until 2017, including the date and location of the match, the two teams that competed, the result, and the scores. It also includes data on individual player performance, such as the number of runs scored, wickets taken, and catches made. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the IPL teams, such as the team name, home ground, and owner. I have used this dataset for my project to analyze it based on various different factors. I have used two different datasets to study the patterns - a) A match dataset listing all the matches that took place from 2008 to 2017, and b) A player by match dataset listing one row of each of the players that played these matches.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning for this analysis includes renaming the columns in both datasets, merging the two datasets, removing/manipulating null values, deleting a few columns that were not required for the analysis, and renaming some values in a few columns that were incorrectly named.

# Team Performance Analysis
With this analysis, I have tried to understand how the teams performed over the 10 years. The number of matches they played and the number of matches won out of those. This type of analysis and visualization help us understand the success pattern of teams and can be used in fantasy gaming platforms to make deductions on which team will be winning against which teams.
